Directions:

STEP1:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch cake tin with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.

STEP2:
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil; mix by hand or beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Add more flour if batter is too runny. Pour into the prepared pan.

STEP3:
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cake carefully onto a cooling rack. Let cool completely.
